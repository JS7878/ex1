The first result is from timely and effective care where lower scores
represent a better performance measure. The second set of results is also
timely and effective care where higher scores represent better performance.
However, readmittance and deaths contain many more responses, much closer to
the total number of 4807 hospitals. For overall procedural assessment,
readmittance and deaths data is much more complete, and the results with the
lowest numbers should be considered the best hospitals for getting a
procedure.
